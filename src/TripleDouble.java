  write a function

   which takes in numbers num1 and num2 and returns 1 if there is a straight triple of a number at any place in num1 and also a straight double of the same number in num2.
   for example:

 TripleDouble(451999277, 41177722899) == 1 // num1 has straight triple 999s and
 // num2 has straight double 99s

 TripleDouble(1222345, 12345) == 0 // num1 has straight triple 2s but num2 has only a single 2

 TripleDouble(12345, 12345) == 0

 TripleDouble(666789, 12345667) == 1

public class TripleDouble {
    public int tripleDouble(long num1, long num2) {

        return 42;
    }
}
